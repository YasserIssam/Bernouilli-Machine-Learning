# Bernouilli-Machine-Learning
In this report, we embark on the journey of applying the Bernoulli Naive Bayes model to the MNIST dataset. Our aim is to gain a deeper understanding of its applicability, strengths, and limitations in the context of digit recognition. We will detail our methodology, experiments, results, and discussions, offering insights into the performance and potential areas for improvement in this classification task.

First, we will describe the problem ath hand, then explain the theory and the model chosen, before implementing this model and study it's experimental results.
